                    supports adherence and compliance with 
                    all COVID-19 health protocols, including 
                    the wearing of masks, sanitising of hands, 
                    and social distancing practices. Should, in 
                    any example of our marketing/advertising 
                    material, a model/actor/actress be depicted 
                    without a mask, this should be considered in 
                    light of the fact that the model/actor/actress 
                    is simply portraying a scenario which may not 
                    necessarily be during a state of lockdown, and 
                    that Redefine's support of, and adherence to, 
                    all COVID-19 health protocols remains.
